Arun Felix and Bhavya Patel

\section{Collaboration}

Bhavya handled the virtual machine environment, since he had an x86 64 machine. I primarily handled the report.

\section{Implementation details}

\section{Difficulties}

We primarily had issues with the Virtual Machine. Bhavya and I had a problem because we both had macbooks, which uses the aarch64 architecture. In the end, Bhavya used his home PC for the VM instead.
